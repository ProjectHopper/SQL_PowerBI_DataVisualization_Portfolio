<h3>In this report, </h3>
#I used SQL query language to extract data from a database and transfer it into Power BI, a data visualization and analysis tool. </br>
SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating data in relational databases, such as MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.</br>
Power BI is a Microsoft product that allows users to create interactive dashboards and reports with various charts, graphs, maps, and other visual elements. </br>
By using SQL and Power BI, I was able to create a visualized Budget Report that shows the income and expenses of a company, as well as the budget variance and performance indicators. </br>
The report can help the company to monitor its financial situation, identify trends and patterns, and make informed decisions.</br>
